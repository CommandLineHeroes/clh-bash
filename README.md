## Development

Install dependencies.

    npm install

Extract the compressed MTL and OBJ files.

    npm run extract

Start the dev server.

    npm start

If you need to make changes to MTL/OBJ files and want to preserve them, run this to compress them.  Only gzipped MTL/OBJ files are saved in the repo.

    npm run compress

## Docker

If you don't have npm stuff installed but you want to play the game, you can run the project on a Docker container.

Run in this directory:

    docker-compose up

You can then play the game at http://localhost:3000, and the Browsersync UI will be at http://localhost:3001.

## Leaderboard selection

Bash supports multiple options for leaderboard storage.  The default is in-browser `localStorage`.  A networked leaderboard is also supported, through sending leaderboard entries to a Parse server.

### Networked leaderboards with Parse

If you want a networked leaderboard, you must have a Parse instance up and running. Then, open `src/config.js` and change `PARSE_URL` to point to the URL of your parse server.

Finally, when you launch Bash, add `&storage=parse` to the end.

### Selecting a leaderboard namespace

Both `localStorage` and Parse leaderboard support namespacing.  In other words, you can give the leaderboard a name.  This is especially useful if you need to maintain multiple leaderboards, for tournament rounds, timed events at conferences, etc.  Switching between leaderboards is as easy as changing the namespace.

Then, when you launch Bash, add `&name=NAMESPACE` to the end of Bash's URL.  Note that you can change the word `NAMESPACE` to be anything you want.
